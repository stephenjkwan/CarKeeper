***** Instructions to Pull Xcode Project from Repo *****
This guide is assumging no experience with Git, and no existing working copy
on your local machine. There may be better ways to do the following steps;
however, this is what I have done.

(working copy - a checkout of the project from the remote repository)
(remote reopository - the repository on the gitlab server)

1. I recommend making a new file on your desktop or wherever you want the
   project to be. In that directory run the following command:

   "git clone https://gitlab.com/utk_cosc340_sp16/team12.git"

   This will create an exact working copy on your local machine
   Or I believe to do this in all one command run the following command:

   RUN THIS COMMAND BELOW IT IS EASIER AND MORE STRAIGHT FORWARD

   "git clone https://gitlab.com/utk_cosc340_sp16/team12.git Desktop/CarKeeper/
   
   This command will clone the repository from the remote repository onto
   your Desktop in a Directory called CarKeeper
   
   To open the project, you will need to either click on the .xcodeproj file
   or execute "open <projName>.xcodeproj

2. Open the project through your GUI, by double clicking on the
   CarKeeper.xcodeproj

3. Now when you commit, add, push (all commands to push your local repo
   to the remote repo) There Are two options:

   IN TERMINAL(RECOMMENDED):
		cd to your local repo:
		based on the above commands it probably is
		"cd ~/Desktop/CarKeeper"
		
		Next git add:
		"git add ." adds everything in that directory(may need more options)

		Next git commit:
		commits to the changes in your local repository
		"git commit -m <message>" 

		Next git push:
		pushes to the remote repository
		"git push origin master"

		If you get this error
		"fatal: Not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git"
		Run following command then run the git push command above: 
		"git remote add origin https://gitlab.com/utk_cosc340_sp16/team12.git"

	IN XCODE(NOT RECOMMENDED ALTHOUGH EASIER):
		The reason I do not recommend this is because I am not sure the exact
		interactions. Also I asked another develop(Kyle Bashour) and he said
		he never uses the apple source control
		
		I dont want to explain this part so lookup a tutorial LOL.
		But in summary go to sourceControl tab and do commit and push
		it should commit directly to the remote repository.
